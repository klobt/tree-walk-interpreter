A simple tree-walk interpreter for a made-up procedural language with C-like syntax. Look into the examples folder to see the language capabilities (which reflect the interpreter's complexity).

The language has:
- while and for-in loops
- if-else statements
- functions (as values)
- arrays
- objects (with method syntax)
- basic things like arithmetic, variable assignment, etc.
